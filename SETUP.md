# CP2 Cloud Sync — Setup Guide

End-to-end: from zero to "team is editing the same dashboard live."
**Time: ~20 minutes**, no server needed, free.

---

## What you're getting

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Edits saved to your browser only | Edits saved to cloud, everyone sees them in ~1s |
| `💾 Save to HTML` → upload to share | Just edit. Done. |
| No auth | Email + password login (admin-created accounts only) |
| No history | Every edit logged: who, when, what |

Files involved:
- **`CP2 Cloud Sync.html`** — the new cloud-enabled dashboard
- **`cloud-sync.js`** — sync engine (don't edit)
- **`firebase-config.js`** — paste your Firebase project keys here
- **`firebase-database-rules.json`** — security rules to upload to Firebase
- **`vercel.json`** — Vercel deployment config (optional)

---

## Step 1 — Create Firebase project (5 min)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com → **Add project**
2. Name it `cp2-tracker` (or whatever). Disable Google Analytics — you don't need it.
3. Once created, in the left sidebar:

### a) Enable Authentication
- **Build → Authentication → Get started**
- Sign-in method tab → **Enable "Email/Password"** → Save
- Settings tab → **User actions** → **Uncheck "Enable create"** (disables self-signup)

### b) Enable Realtime Database
- **Build → Realtime Database → Create database**
- Location: **United States (us-central1)** (closest to your team)
- Start in **locked mode** — we'll paste real rules next.
- Once created, click the **Rules** tab.
- Replace the contents with the contents of `firebase-database-rules.json` from this project. **Publish.**

### c) Register a Web App
- Project Overview (gear icon) → **Project settings**
- Scroll to **Your apps** → click `</>` (Web)
- Nickname: `CP2 Dashboard`
- **Skip** Firebase Hosting
- It will show you a `firebaseConfig = { ... }` snippet. **Copy those values.**

### d) Paste into `firebase-config.js`
Open `firebase-config.js` in this project, paste the values from step (c). It should look like:

```js
window.FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey:      "AIzaSy...real-key...",
  authDomain:  "cp2-tracker.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://cp2-tracker-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
  projectId:   "cp2-tracker",
  ...
};
```

> ⚠️ `apiKey` is **not** a secret — it's a project identifier. Real protection comes from the database rules + auth login.

---

## Step 2 — Create team accounts (2 min per person)

For each teammate (5–15 people):

1. Firebase Console → **Authentication → Users tab → Add user**
2. Enter their email + a temporary password
3. Send them the email + temp password through Slack/text
4. They sign in at the dashboard → click "Forgot password" to set their own

That's it. **No self-signup, no spam, you control who has access.**

---

## Step 3 — Deploy (pick one)

### Option A — Vercel (recommended, free, public URL)

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo (private is fine)
2. Go to https://vercel.com → **New Project → Import** your repo
3. Framework preset: **Other**. Click Deploy.
4. After ~30s you'll have a URL like `cp2-tracker.vercel.app`
5. Send it to your team. They open the URL → see the login → sign in → done.

The `vercel.json` in this folder makes `/` serve the dashboard.

> Since auth is handled in-app, the public URL is fine — anyone hitting it without an account just sees the login wall.

### Option B — SharePoint / OneDrive shared link

1. Drop the **whole folder** (`CP2 Cloud Sync.html`, `cloud-sync.js`, `firebase-config.js`) into a SharePoint document library
2. Right-click the HTML → **Copy link**
3. Send the link.
4. **Important:** SharePoint must open it in the browser (not download). For a folder of files this works if you host in SharePoint Pages, otherwise use Vercel/Netlify.

### Option C — Netlify drop (zero-config)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag this whole folder onto the page
3. Get a URL, share it. Done.

### Option D — Internal company server (most private)

Just serve the folder with any static file server (nginx, IIS, even `python -m http.server`). Same files, no internet exposure.

## How team members use it

1. Open the URL → see login screen
2. Sign in with their assigned email
3. **Edit anything** — click a marker, edit status, add log entries
4. **Changes save automatically** to cloud — no "Save" button needed
5. The green **Live** indicator in the header confirms sync is working
6. When someone else edits, a toast appears: *"↻ Updated by alice"*
7. The user menu (top right) has:
   - 📜 Edit history (who changed what, when)
   - 👥 Who's online
   - ↪ Sign out

---

## Operation playbook

### "I want to add a new teammate"
Firebase Console → Authentication → Add user. Send them email + temp password.

### "Someone left the company"
Firebase Console → Authentication → find their row → ⋮ menu → **Delete account**. They lose access instantly.

### "We need to reset everything"
Firebase Console → Realtime Database → click the root node `/` → ⋮ → Delete. Next time someone opens the dashboard, it'll re-seed from the local HTML.

### "I want to download a backup"
Firebase Console → Realtime Database → ⋮ menu → **Export JSON**.

### "Two people edited at the same time"
Last save wins. The earlier edit is overwritten. The history panel shows both edits so you can manually re-apply the lost one. (We picked simple-merge per your spec — switch to field-level if conflicts become common.)

### "I want to check who changed something"
Top-right user menu → **Edit history**. Last 200 edits shown with timestamp + user + change summary.

## Free-tier limits (Firebase Spark plan)

For a 5–15 person team doing 50 edits/day each, you'll use:
- ~30 MB/day downloaded (limit: 10 GB/month) — **0.3% of limit**
- ~1 MB stored (limit: 1 GB) — **0.1% of limit**
- ~1500 simultaneous connections used at peak (limit: 100 concurrent) — **plenty**

You will not pay anything. If usage explodes, upgrade to Blaze (pay-as-you-go) — typical bill: <$1/month even for heavy use.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
|---|---|
| Red banner "Firebase config missing" | You haven't edited `firebase-config.js` |
| Login says "Wrong email or password" | Account doesn't exist yet — add it in Firebase Console |
| Status indicator stuck on "Offline" | Check browser console for CORS / network errors. Most often: database rules not published, or `databaseURL` wrong. |
| "Permission denied" in console | The database rules in step 1b weren't pasted/published. Repeat. |
| Edits don't appear on other browsers | Open browser devtools → Application → Service Workers → unregister any. Then refresh. |
| Old saved-to-HTML data showing instead of cloud | The cloud version reads from cloud only — old `Save to HTML` snapshots embedded in the file are ignored once cloud has data. To wipe and re-seed: delete `/state` in Firebase Console. |

---

## Files you can still use from the old workflow

- `💾 Save to HTML` button is **still there** for offline backups. Saving locally also pushes to cloud, so you get both.
- `⬇ Export JSON` / `⬆ Import JSON` still work for bulk operations.

---

## Security notes

- **The `apiKey` in `firebase-config.js` is not secret.** Firebase keys identify your project; security comes from auth + database rules.
- **Database rules** require `auth != null` for all reads/writes — anonymous access is impossible.
- **Self-signup is disabled** in step 1a — only emails you add manually can sign in.
- **HTTPS is enforced** automatically by Vercel/Netlify/Firebase.
- For extra paranoia, restrict the API key to specific HTTP referrers: Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → your key → Application restrictions → HTTP referrers → add `your-domain.vercel.app/*`.
